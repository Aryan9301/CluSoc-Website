# CluSoc-Website

This is a unique website made for the students of NIT Kurukshetra. It allows all the students to view the various different types of official Cultural Clubs & Technical Societies that are present in the institute. It also gives the students what all tasks are performed by a particular club or society.


Using HTML5, CSS, JavaScript and PHP, the website is made interactive and user friendly. The site contains a registration and login page which enables the users to create their own profiles. In their profiles they can add their interests and check which club or society best suits them. The About Me page enables the users to mail their queries regarding any club or society that they might have.
